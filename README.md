Exploring state in React by creating a todo app

## Tasks I aim to acheive
- [x] With useState have Add and remove items functionality
- [x] Move to using Reducers to dispatch actions
- [ ] Make item cards to improve UI
- [ ] Create an updateItem action for updating the text
- [ ] Create a done toggle button that uses updateItem
- [ ] Create a archived state and archive button
- [ ] Create a second view for archived, that letâ€™s me switch between todo and archived
- [ ] Create unarchive, and clear archive buttons
- [ ] Create a select all to mass update
- [ ] Add a filter search for both views
- [ ] Add tags and tag filter (and views for tags if you like)
- [ ] Store the data in localstorage
- [ ] Move to use context API
- [ ] Create a hook to fetch and store data in localstorage (edited) 
- [ ] Move to use redux
